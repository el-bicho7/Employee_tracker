# Employee Tracker  

## Description 
This project was made so we can practice with the sql postgres. We created a db and seeded to sql, and with that database we worked. The database is an employee database. 

The database contains departments, role, and employees. The department is connected to the roles, as the roles and employees are connected. This application works in the console.
